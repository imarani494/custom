This project is a Custom React Table Component designed to handle dynamic tabular data with powerful features like sorting, filtering, and flexible column configurations.
The table is built using React and leverages hooks like useState and useMemo for efficient state andrendering management.



Dynamic Columns:
Columns can be configured dynamically, with options to enable or disable sorting and filtering based on requirements.

Sorting:

Sorting functionality allows data to be ordered in ascending or descending order.
Users can click column headers to toggle between sorting directions.
Filtering:

Each filterable column provides a dedicated input field for real-time filtering.
Filters are case-insensitive and match substrings, ensuring ease of use.
Reusable and Modular:

The component is designed to be easily integrated into any React application.
Components like TableHeader, TableBody, and FilterInput ensure modularity and reusability.
Optimized Performance:

Sorting and filtering are optimized using useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Filters and sorted results are dynamically computed based on the current state.
Customizable Data Handling:
Developers can easily provide their dataset and define the structure using column configurations.

Example Use Case:
The table is ideal for applications requiring tabular displays, such as:

Admin Dashboards: Manage user data or transactional records.
Inventory Management Systems: Display products with filtering and sorting.
CRM Systems: Search and sort customer data for better accessibility.
Technical Highlights:


Built with React functional components and hooks.
Includes customizable configurations for each column (e.g., sortable, filterable).
Uses efficient data transformation techniques to manage large datasets.
This component ensures an intuitive, responsive, and efficient way to handle tabular data in modern React applications. Let me know if you'd like additional details or code examples!
